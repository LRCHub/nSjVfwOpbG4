[00:01.32] Are you you? Are you me?
[00:05.93] Or someone in between?
[00:08.81] You lost track inside the labyrinth
[00:12.97] You lost your will and your sanity
[00:16.33] You certainly lost your humanity
[00:20.23] In life, you have taken much more than you're worth
[00:24.83] Now it's your turn to give back to the Earth
[00:37.08] May you return to the ground and ossify
[00:41.45] It's time for you to die, die, die

[00:14.10] All winter, we got carried
[00:17.32] Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
[00:21.08] All summer, we just hurried
[00:24.73] So come over, just be patient and don't worry
[00:42.48] So come over, just be patient and don't worry
[01:04.98] 
[00:45.35] So come over, just be patient and don't worry
[01:07.85] 
[00:48.84] And don't worry
[00:56.34] 
[00:52.58] No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
[00:55.87] I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
[00:59.56] I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends
[01:25.06] 
[01:01.46] No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
[01:05.77] I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
[01:08.66] I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends
[01:34.16] 
[01:13.27] And, in the end, we lie awake
[01:17.53] And we dream of making our escape
[01:19.99] And, in the end, we lie awake
[01:22.64] And we dream of making our escape
